# Course Description

> The course examines the contemporary and historical relationship between communication technology, society and culture. In the first half students will study the communication infrastructure from a number of perspectives: philosophically, geographically, technically, ideologically, materially, and as part of nation building. The second half is dedicated to technologies, such as platforms, applications and software that co-evolved and were enabled in some part by the underlying communication infrastructure. Students will learn to critically examine the following: hacking and technological citizenship; the sharing economy & Bitcoin; dashboards & control rooms, smart cities & precision agriculture; autonomous cars & drones, IoT; the mediation of love; technological resistance & surveillance, among many others.

# Course Objectives

Students will:
* learn that the material technology of communication infrastructure is a feat of engineering, but also science, society, culture, geography, politics and ideology;
* study old and contemporary technologies as an assemblage of artefacts, networks, systems, institutions, practices, and people; 
* think critically about technology by engaging with key sociological and philosophical concepts and contextualize these with examples;
* acquire the knowledge and skill to identify and distinguish technological narratives and the vocabulary to describe and articulate them;
* and finally, develop their ability to critically examine technology.

## Week 1 (Jan.10) – Introduction – What is Technology?

Welcome to the class! We will get to know each other, go over readings and learning objectives.  We will begin to define technology, and explore its meaning by discussing the devices and apps we wear, carry with us and use every day.  You will also begin to learn how to frame technology ideologically and to critically discuss whether or not artifacts have politics.   

#### Class will be informed by:

#### Assignment 1 
> In 3 pages you are to write about a technology that you carry with you or use every day, it can be a device or an app, one you think you cannot do without. Abstain from using that technology for a full 24 hour period and keep a diary of observations related to that abstention. Name the device or app, name the company that made it, state where it is made, the cost, does it rely on any underlying infrastructure, if there are ongoing costs, to whom do you pay these costs, how often have you replaced it, can it be recycled, can you modify/hack it, is there is a terms of use; what is it and who owns the data and what are your privacy rights, describe the device aesthetically, instrumentally, and emotionally and discuss how you use it. Include observations from your diary about your 24 hour abstention.

## Week 2 (Jan. 17) – Technology, Society and Culture

In this class we will define what a socio-technological perspective is, and discuss the social shaping qualities of technology. Students will learn that social and cultural changes are not solely determined by technology but are intertwined with a combination of micro-, meso, and macro-level processes.  Some of the concepts that will be discussed are: augmentation and wearables, simulation and artificial intelligence, autonomous technologies such as the autonomous cars and UAVs or drones, cyborgs and transhumanism.

## Week 10 (Mar. 21) – Surveillance and Policing

Assange and Snowden have changed the nature of media reporting, their actions put a spotlight on the privatization of the internet infrastructure, the monitoring of content and government snooping.  Traditional media channels have been put into question and blackboxed state secrets about the misdeeds of government were made public.  Whether they be friends or foes, our relationship with media and government has changed. Students will also learn to define surveillance and examine it from different perspectives including ways to resist it.

## Week 11 (Mar. 28) – Ethics and the Environment

The internet is not virtual, it is very material and there are implications to 24/7 access in terms of energy consumption, server farms need to be cooled, powered and require buildings and fibre let alone all of the materials required to produce the servers. Built in obsolescence combined with the status of the latest and greatest of electronics has led to e-waste and in some parts of the world political strife resulting from the mining of precious metals. Communication technology has an ecological footprint and presents us with ethical issues. This week students will be exposed to different points of view regarding progress, inequality, neutrality, design destiny as well as privacy and strained attention and e-mining.
